# Infinite Trader Money

No more hoarding gear you don't care about, no more sleeping endlessly, no more waiting.

Sell all your gear whenever you want to. Infinite money for traders.

## Installing the mod

1. Download the [zipped mod file](./data.rar) to your machine;
1. Unzip this file. It will contain a single file named `data.win`.
1. Go to Zero Sievert's installation path
	1. If installed through Steam, go to the game properties, local files and browse.
1. Move the unzipped `data.win` file into the `ZERO Sievert` directory
	1. A message will state a file with the same name already exists. Select the option to overwrite the existing file.
1. Launch the game. The mod is now active.

*Attention:* If you'd like to disable the mod eventually, you'll need to keep a backup of the original `data.win` file found in the `ZERO Sievert` directory.
