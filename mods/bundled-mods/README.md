	1. If installed through Steam, go to the game properties, local files and browse.
1. Move the unzipped `data.win` file into the `ZERO Sievert` directory
	1. A message will state a file with the same name already exists. Select the option to overwrite the existing file.

*Attention:* If you'd like to disable the mod bundle eventually, you'll need to keep a backup of the original `data.win` file found in the `ZERO Sievert` directory.
