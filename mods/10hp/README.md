# Only 10 HP

[Zero Sievert](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782120/ZERO_Sievert/) is a challenging game. Only the best and bravest are able to survive its harsh enemies.

For some, however, that challenge is still not enough.

`Only 10 HP` reduces your character's max health to a measly 10 hit points. Can you survive Zakov *now*?

## Installing the mod

1. Download the [zipped mod file](./data.zip) to your machine;
1. Unzip this file. It will contain a single file named `data.win`.
1. Go to Zero Sievert's installation path
	1. If installed through Steam, go to the game properties, local files and browse.
1. Move the unzipped `data.win` file into the `ZERO Sievert` directory
	1. A message will state a file with the same name already exists. Select the option to overwrite the existing file.
1. Launch the game. Your character will now have a max amount of 10 hit points.

*Attention:* If you'd like to disable the mod eventually, you'll need to keep a backup of the original `data.win` file found in the `ZERO Sievert` directory.

## FAQ
---
*Q.* Will this mod affect my current saves?

*A.* Yes. After installing the mod, all characters will always have max 10 HP.

---

*Q.* If I uninstall the mod, what happens to the max HP of the characters?

*A.* The max HP of the characters will return back to its regular value (default 75)

---

*Q.* Can this mod work with other Zero Sievert mods?

*A.* As of now, there is no way to load two mods at once. Modder cooperation would be required to merge two mods together.

---

*Q.* This mod is very tiny, why don't you make something larger?

*A.* Currently the game is still under development so there's not much sense in writing huge mods, as the upkeep of those would be nearly impossible with the speed the game is changing. I am still learning how to mod this game, but my plan is to introduce many different mods, mostly focusing on increasing the challenge of the game as well as improving QoL. This is a first dip in the waters for me.
