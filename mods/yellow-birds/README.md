# Yellow Birds

Gunshots are whizzing by. You shoot down multiple enemies! Constantly repositioning to ensure you always catch them by surprise. In the shadows and moving fast. The last enemy drops, your path free to all that loot.

But... Where are all the corpses?!?! Goddammit, I can HEAR those birds but I'll be damned if I can see them...!

If this is you, you've found the perfect mod. `Yellow Birds` puts a beautiful yellow coat of paint on crows to ensure they are clearly visible in the beautiful 8-bit environment of Zakov.

## Installing the mod

1. Download the [zipped mod file](./data.rar) to your machine;
1. Unzip this file. It will contain a single file named `data.win`.
1. Go to Zero Sievert's installation path
	1. If installed through Steam, go to the game properties, local files and browse.
1. Move the unzipped `data.win` file into the `ZERO Sievert` directory
	1. A message will state a file with the same name already exists. Select the option to overwrite the existing file.
1. Launch the game. The mod is now active.

*Attention:* If you'd like to disable the mod eventually, you'll need to keep a backup of the original `data.win` file found in the `ZERO Sievert` directory.
